# metadata-sampler

Tabular representation of loc.gov metadata fields attached to results in query records, broken down by loc.gov collections.

Data harvested using the locgov-collection-query-record-metadata-fields.ipynb Jupyter Notebook in repo. Data saved as /docs/data/loc_fields.json. Displayed on https://reliztrent.github.io/metadata-sampler using jQuery DataTables.

This is a just-for-fun project, not an official product created or endorsed by LOC.
